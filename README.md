## Overview

Converting an excellent tutorial from a couple years ago.

---
## Feature Tasks and Requirements
 - Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the [Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/) tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.

     - To accomplish your primary task you’ll need install several libraries and external assets.

- A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.

- Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.

---

## Testing

- No automated testing requirements for this lab.

---

## Tools and Dependencies

- Poetry
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyterlab
- scikit-learn

---

## Getting Started
